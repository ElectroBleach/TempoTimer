# TempoTimer
TempoTimer is a race preparation aid and is an auditory race simulation for swimmers. This purpose of this application is to allow swimmers to experience their races more vividly while performing pre-race visualization exercises before race day, thereby resulting in better performance in the pool.

#### How to use TempoTimer

TempoTimer provides auditory feedback based on the tempo, race type, and goal time entered by users. Users may also choose to enter their splits manually or have them generated based on the goal time they inputted. 

First, users must enter their race length, course of their race (LCM, SCY, SCM), and tempo. Next, the user must declare whether they'd like to input their splits manually or have them generated. If the automatic split option is selected, the user will also have to input a 50 offset value. For instance, if a time entered were 1:00.00, the race length was 100Y, and the offset value was 5, the 50 splits would be 27.5 and 32.5 due to the 5-second offset value. 

After filling in the required fields, users press start to begin the auditory simulation which will play back a starter sound, a looping beep at the inputted tempo, the time at which they will turn, and the time at which they will finish.
